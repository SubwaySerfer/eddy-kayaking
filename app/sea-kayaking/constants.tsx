          Born and raised in Crimea, it was impossible not to be shaped by the
          stunning natural beauty — towering mountains and the endless Black
          Sea. Rodion’s journey began as a dockworker and led him to become a
          certified sea kayaking guide, specializing in multi-day expeditions.
          Over five years in water tourism, he completed numerous trips along
          both the Crimean and Turkish coastlines
        </p>
        <p>
          During two years in Turkey, he trained under the international
          standards of ISKGA (International Sea Kayak Guide Association),
          completing modules in Incident Management, Expedition Skills, and Sea
          Survival under the mentorship of Lee Waters.

          Born far from the sea but always drawn to the horizon. At 25, Taras
          has already lived two lives — one on the quiet trails of distant
          coasts, the other in the vast engine rooms of the open ocean. He has
          paddled along the rugged shores of Crimea and the warm, pine-scented
          coastline of southern Turkey, gaining real expedition experience
          through his own curiosity and persistence.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not guiding from a kayak, he works as a certified seafarer aboard
          international tankers, crossing entire seas on long and demanding
          voyages.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Taras, the sea is both a calling and a constant. Whether it’s a
          calm morning tour or a night shift under a star-filled sky, he moves
          with focus, confidence, and deep respect for the elements. Adventure
          is not a side of his life — it is the heart of it.
